# Searching Algorithms in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## Overview
This repository contains implementations and explanations of various searching algorithms commonly used in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The main goal is to provide clear and concise code examples along with conceptual understanding to help learners grasp the fundamentals of searching techniques.

## Searching Algorithms Covered
### Linear Search: 
A straightforward approach where each element in the list is checked sequentially until the target is found.

### Binary Search: 
An efficient algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### Other Searching Techniques: 
he notebook may also cover variants or advanced searching algorithms depending on the content.

## Purpose
To provide a learning resource for students and beginners to understand how searching algorithms work.
To demonstrate the implementation of searching algorithms using Python.
To compare the efficiency and use cases of different searching methods.

## How to Use This Repository
Open the Jupyter Notebook DSA.ipynb in a Jupyter environment like Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Read through the explanations and study the code implementations.
Run the cells interactively to see the algorithms in action.
Modify the code to test with different inputs and deepen your understanding.

## Why Searching Algorithms Matter
Searching is a fundamental operation in computer science used in a variety of applications, including:
